## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository showcases how to integrate **Knowledge Graphs** with **RAG systems** to enhance structured knowledge representation and improve semantic search.  
The notebooks guide you step by step, from querying with Cypher to building knowledge graphs from text and finally integrating them into a chatbot interface.
