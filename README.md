# Knowledge Graphs for RAG

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems.  

Through a series of Jupyter notebooks, you will learn how to:  
- Build a KG from text  
- Query it with Cypher  
- Expand it with new information  
- Use it to power a simple RAG chat demo
